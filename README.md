# üé• Smart Video Categorization System: Audio Transcript Analysis

## üéØ Project Overview & Motivation

[cite_start]This project introduces an automated **Machine Learning-based Video Classification System** that categorizes video content by analyzing the **actual spoken words** in the video, providing a reliable alternative to traditional methods that rely on easily manipulated titles or metadata[cite: 1, 17, 19, 283].

[cite_start]The system's core function is to address the serious concern of videos being **misclassified or intentionally mislabeled** (e.g., violent content with innocent titles) to bypass filtering systems[cite: 2, 3, 17].

### Key Categories
[cite_start]The system automatically classifies uploaded videos into five predefined categories based on spoken content[cite: 7, 20, 175]:
* **Auto & Vehicles**
* **Cooking**
* **Education**
* **Pets & Animals**
* **Sports**

### Real-World Applications
[cite_start]The system can be applied in several real-life situations, including[cite: 9, 10, 11, 285]:
* [cite_start]Video platforms (like YouTube) for detecting and preventing wrongly labeled videos[cite: 9].
* [cite_start]Content moderation for identifying potentially harmful or misleading content[cite: 11].
* [cite_start]Parental controls and filtering educational content in schools and libraries[cite: 10].

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Methodology and Technical Stack

[cite_start]The system processes a raw video through a clear, six-step sequence to convert audio to text and predict the final category[cite: 177, 185]:

### Classification Pipeline
1.  [cite_start]**Video Upload (Flask Interface):** User uploads a video through the simple web interface[cite: 188].
2.  [cite_start]**Audio Extraction (FFmpeg):** The audio track is extracted from the video file and saved in MP3 format[cite: 150, 151, 193, 195].
3.  [cite_start]**Speech-to-Text (OpenAI Whisper):** The audio is converted into an accurate text transcript[cite: 154, 180, 198].
4.  [cite_start]**Text Preprocessing & Keyword Highlighting (NLTK):** The transcript is cleaned (tokenization, stop-word removal) and compared against the keyword dataset[cite: 140, 180, 202, 204].
5.  [cite_start]**Feature Extraction (TF-IDF):** The cleaned text is converted into a numerical matrix using **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency‚ÄìInverse Document Frequency)[cite: 181, 208].
6.  [cite_start]**Classification (Logistic Regression):** The TF-IDF features are fed into the trained Logistic Regression model to predict the category with a confidence score[cite: 182, 215, 223].

### Technology Stack

| **Classification Model** | **Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)** | [cite_start]Simple, effective algorithm for text classification with probability predictions[cite: 134, 218, 220, 223]. |
| **Web Interface** | **Flask** | [cite_start]Lightweight framework for the interactive web frontend (upload/results)[cite: 129, 131]. |
| **Audio Utility** | **FFmpeg** | [cite_start]Handles cross-platform audio extraction and conversion[cite: 150, 152]. |
| **NLP Processing** | **NLTK** | [cite_start]Used for text cleaning, tokenization, and stop-word removal[cite: 140, 144]. |

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone your-repo-url-here
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    *(You need to generate a `requirements.txt` file from your Python code's imports)*
    ```bash
    # Install all required Python packages (e.g., Flask, sklearn, whisper, NLTK, pandas)
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    ```
3.  **Run the Flask application:**
